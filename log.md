Devlog 1

Just a project to entertain myself with. To be honest, I don't know how far I'll take this; it might just be a small thing I do during school. I know my pal Keegan C's making the art, so that'll be nice. I gotta learn a lot of stuff before this takes off. At least I have minecraft alpha to copy off of.

My guess: eventually I'll forget how to type capital letters if i let the computer-style devlog typing carry me to far...

Devlog 2

I've gotten the hang of it; sort of. I've coded on intellij a few times before, and am definitely more used to the workflow here; it's much better than the one on repl.it anyway, I should only use that one for python. 

I changed the name, source, and file structure of the code; now it's much more neat, readable, compressible, and runnable; the whole package. I'm currently watching my neighbor have a stroke on a flight simulator now instead of coding, brb.

Ok I'm bacc. I've gotten an idea on game design: platformer based on daydreaming; perhaps the character can enter a parallel stage at will dependent on position? Will definitely confer with a friend before, but first I should develop a stable graphics environment.
